fat busy cat riding horses in the sky
hoping for the sky to stop being so fat so the cat can run freely
but the fat sky didn't open up for the cat
He loved the sky but didn't know if he loved this picture
Ending up loving the picture of the fat sky the cat became fat
Being fat he felt like a massive cow and started walking slowly dreaming of beef
